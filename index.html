<p>geographical factors. In fact, the study embraced basic data storage, information<br>
    retrieval, and the use and sharing of knowledge bases which had evolved in each of the<br>
    organisations: in many ways, the knowledge issues proved to be the most interesting and<br>
    challenging.</p>  
<p>We were given a framework within which to operate, which was defined in relation to<br>
    enhanced customer service, “best value”, economies of scale, and more effective<br>
    working. The output required was a “draft report for further consideration, detailing the<br>
    options for Inter-County Joint Emergency Service sharing and exchange of caller<br>
    information”</p>    
<p>Specifically, the specification of the study can be defined as below.</p>   
<p><u><h3>Problem Content, Scope and Objectives</h3></u></p>
<p>• An examination of the current arrangements between Barfordshire Police, Ambu-<br>
    lance and Paramedic Service, and Fire & Rescue Service for the sharing and<br>
    exchange of caller information between the services.<br>
    • An exploration into the feasibility of enhancing the sharing and exchange of caller<br>
    information between the above, taking into account: technological potential and<br>
    constraints; organisational issues; geographical factors.</p>
<p><u><h3>Project Outcomes</h3></u></p> 
<p>• A feasibility study looking at joint working in the exchange and sharing of caller<br>
    information, and yielding the potential benefits of: enhanced customer service,<br>
    “best value”, economies of scale, and more effective working.</p>
<p><u><h3>Outline Project Deliverables and/or Desired Outcomes</h3></u></p>
<p>A Draft Report for further consideration, detailing the options for Inter-County Joint<br>
    Emergency Service sharing and exchange of caller information.</p>  
    <p><ul><u><h2>The Approach</h2></u></ul></p> 
<p><u><h3>Purpose</h3></u></p> 
<p>The project was conducted within the Best Value framework (AuditCommission 1998).<br>
    Best Value was a U.K. Government initiative of the time, a key purpose of which was to<br>
    improve public services, especially at a local level. A series of three participative sessions<br>
    </p>    
<p>were held to inform the study and to contribute to the “consult” (AuditCommission 2000)<br>
    element of Best Value. The events would also contribute to informing the ‘challenge’<br>
    element of the Best Value framework and potentially enable people to question the<br>
    rationale for the current fragmented emergency service call handling and information<br>
    sharing processes.</p>
<p>It was felt that a participative approach involving people from all the organisations<br>
    involved would begin to breakdown any organisational cultural barriers and begin to<br>
    develop a common understanding of how the different organisations worked.</p>   
<p><u><h3>Process</h3></u></p>
<p>The participative sessions were held on three separate days, one to develop the issues<br>
    about the organisations working together and two others to gain information about<br>
    technical (IT) issues and human resources issues respectively.</p>
<p>The initial event was an open space (Owen, 1997) session where approximately 20 people<br>
    from each of the Ambulance and Police Services attended. Two later sessions concen-<br>
    trated on the technical and HR aspects of greater collaboration and attendees were fewer<br>
    in number and limited to the experts in the areas being explored, namely information<br>
    technology and human resources. For these two later events, interactive planning<br>
    (Ackoff 1981) and critical systems heuristics (Ulrich 1983) were used. All the organisations<br>
    involved except the Fire services were represented. These remaining organisations<br>
    found elements of common ground and began to explore the technical and HR issues.</p>
<p>The events took the form of a chaired discussion testing ideas and assumptions about<br>
    collaboration between the organisations. The experts shared technical information about<br>
    their IT systems and began to explore the potential for working together. Lists of issues<br>
    raised were produced by each group which informed the study.</p>  
 <p><u><h3>Findings</h3></u></p>
<p>The participative sessions highlighted the problem of engagement for the organisations<br>
    that would have been masked had they not been held. The project board formed with<br>
    executive officers from each of the emergency services appeared to exhibit a broad<br>
    consensus about the value of exploring the potential for collaborative work. However,<br>
    that commitment was tested demonstrably when it came to sending people to the<br>
    participative sessions. In terms of participation, non-attendance speaks volumes about<br>
    the commitment of participants within a partnership. The issues about these emergency<br>
    services collaborating in call handling or information sharing were exposed as being<br>
    primarily human centred, cultural and managerial and less about the technical issues.</p>
<p> Similar problems have been experienced in another area of the United Kingdom where the<br>
    emergency services were actively working towards a shared control room, but the cultural<br>
    and human centred issues have got in the way of implementation.
    </p>   
<p><ul><u><h2>Findings of Feasibility Study</h2></u></ul></p> 
<p>The comments in this section should be seen in the context of access to the Fire Service<br>
    being only at Principal Officer level. Access to Fire control rooms in Barfordshire has not<br>
    been possible. A joint Ambulance and Fire Service control room has been visited at<br>
    Warwickshire, and the visits to three joint control (Fire, Police and Ambulance) sites in<br>
    Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Cleveland provided further information, although none<br>
    of these three sites was operational at the time of the study.</p>  
<p><u><h3>Organisational Feasibility</h3></u></p>
<p>The services share their knowledge on a daily, operational basis, via telephone between<br>
    control rooms, and person to person communication at incident locations. There is,<br>
    however, no sharing of information on an organised basis. NB: At the time of the study,<br>
    the Home Office was championing the implementation of a new combined radio and other<br>
    data communication system called Airwave (www.airwaveservice.co.uk).</p>
<p>Enhancing the sharing of information implies improved enabling technologies for such<br>
    sharing, including the new public service radio communications platform, and mobile<br>
    data/automatic vehicle location.</p> 
<p>1. Improved enabling technologies for information sharing.</p>
   <p> a. Airwave or an equivalent communication platform [note that there is strong<br>
    evidence—per Jack Straw (Home Secretary): see Police Information Technol-<br>
    ogy Organisation Web site (www.pito.org.uk)—that all Police forces will be<br>
    committed to Airwave; as I write, all forces have agreed to take it]. More<br>
    information is needed to evaluate Airwave, and plan other technologies and<br>
    the necessary organisational procedures around them.</p>
<p>   b. Mobile data, linked with automatic vehicle location, is a major opportunity for<br>
    data sharing between agencies. IT applications providing learning systems<br>
    based on these technologies are available now.</p><br>  
<p>All of this adds up to a major management tool for the deployment of resources based<br>
    on mapping systems, and according to known and targeted response levels.</p>
<p>2. Information sharing at other than operational levels</p>  
<p>There is evidence of sharing information at other than operational levels, of which the<br>
    Inter County Joint Emergency Services Group in Barfordshire is an example. However,<br>
    an overall explicit, articulated strategic focus, shared by all, is lacking. The situation with<br>
    Airwave, which admittedly is driven by Government and therefore not entirely within the<br>
    </p>
<p>control of even the three services on a national basis, highlights this. A given service (e.g.,<br>
    the Police) is expected to “buy in” to Airwave: but none of the following questions are<br>
    systematically addressed: where does this fit with communication strategies overall; what<br>
    is the long term view; what about mobile data; what are the operational considerations?</p>
<p>PITO (Police Information Technology Organisation) is charged by government with<br>
    designing common IS and IT requirements for implementation across all Police services<br>
    in England and Wales. This brings added complications concerning the ability of<br>
    individual forces to change IS and IT in line with government requirements, given the<br>
    need to improve some systems immediately and the competing pressure to conform to<br>
    a PITO standard that might be several years away from readiness. This situation is further<br>
    complicated by the narrow development of Police IS and IT, and probably Ambulance<br>
    and Fire, in not designing systems that integrate the three services. A notable exception<br>
    being Cleveland Police where they have employed integrated IS for a number of years.</p> 
<p><u><h3>Structure Issues</h3></u></p> 
<p>The organisational structure of Fire, Police and Ambulance Services has been investi-<br>
    gated through visits to sites and discussions with relevant personnel.</p> 
<p>A number of issues related to structure became clearer as a result of this study. For<br>
    example, one overriding issue was the different levels of complexity within each of the<br>
    services in handling caller information. In general terms, the Fire Service seems to have<br>
    the most clearly defined procedures, which are easiest to follow. The Ambulance Service<br>
    control systems exhibit more complexity, and a greater need for overall management,<br>
    whilst mostly occurring under resource pressure. The Police Service has a much wider<br>
    remit, with a wider variety and greater number of calls, requiring considerably more<br>
    decision-making at the point of call receipt.</p> 
<p>Consequently, the two Police Services have to “manage” demand in order to meet the<br>
    needs of their clients. Whilst the Fire Service deals only with emergency calls, and the<br>
    Ambulance Service has clear categories of calls to which it has to respond, and which<br>
    it prioritises. This gives the Ambulance Service a particular problem, in that it has to<br>
    manage the knowledge relating to its own activities or those of the Fire and Police<br>
    Services, on, at times, a minute-by-minute basis. As an example, an emergency call to the<br>
    Fire Service is always responded to. The vehicles and teams to send are, for the most part,<br>
    allocated according to set rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are such<br>
    that they can be incorporated within an automated system. Except in major emergencies,<br>
    control of the incident, from inception of the instruction to eventual return to station, can<br>
    be left largely with the operational fire teams attending the incident—central co-<br>
    ordination is much less of an issue than with Ambulance or Police.
    </p>   
<p><u><h3>Ambulance Service</h3></u></p>
<p>The Ambulance Service for Barfordshire has a control centre in Barford. The centre uses<br>
    a computerised system for call taking and despatch, included within which (currently<br>
    available or planned) are mapping, mobile data and automated vehicle location systems<br>
    </p>
<p>(AVLS). The system uses a single radio system. Ambulance and Paramedic Service<br>
    command and control is supplied by a proprietory system.</p>    
<p>The Ambulance and Paramedic Service call taking and despatch system is an example of<br>
    a system often under severe resource pressure, frequently resulting in a need to carefully<br>
    schedule vehicles to meet the current demand. Any joint working which can enhance<br>
    Ambulance and Paramedic Service performance is estimated to yield immediate benefits<br>
    in terms of response times, which are subject to National targets.</p>
<p><u><h3>Police Service</h3></u></p> 
<p>The Police Service for Barfordshire has two central control centres (or “information<br>
    centres”). One, in Barford, has recently been refurbished, and monitors all calls across<br>
    the County. A computer system is used, together with UHF and VHF radio systems (now<br>
    replaced). There is no AVLS or mapping, and no mobile data. The other, in a neighbouring<br>
    county town, is in the process of rolling out the Airwave implementation. The same<br>
    computer system as that in Barford is used (although the procedures for using it differ),<br>
    together with UHF and VHF radio systems (now replaced). There is no AVLS or mapping,<br>
    and no systematic application of mobile data [e.g., the Armed Response Vehicles (ARVs)<br>
    use laptops to link in to central systems remotely].</p> 
<p>Police Services have to “manage” demand in order to meet the needs of their clients.<br>
    Forces have adopted systems of “graded response” which they apply to calls for service.<br>
    For example, Grade 1—immediate response, grade 2—respond but at normal traffic<br>
    speeds, grade 3—by appointment, grade 4—no police attendance required. As men-<br>
    tioned earlier, whilst the Fire Service deals only with emergency calls, and the Ambulance<br>
    Service has clear categories of calls to which it has to respond, and which it prioritises,<br>
    the range of calls which the Police Service has to respond to is much more varied. A<br>
    distinction is made between emergency and non-emergency calls, but the classification<br>
    of a call as emergency or non-emergency is not always clear cut. This is an issue which<br>
    impacts future development, and to which I will return later in the report.</p> 
<p><u><h3>Fire Service</h3></u></p> 
<p>In the case of the Fire Service, there have been limited opportunities to assess the<br>
    operation, but from the evidence gathered it is possible to make the following preliminary<br>
    assessment of the emergency systems:</p><br>
<p>1. An emergency call to the Fire Service is always responded to.</p>
<p></p>    2. The vehicles and teams to send are, for the most part, allocated according to set<br>
    rules and procedures. These rules and procedures are such that they can be<br>
    incorporated within an automated system.</p>
     <p>    3. Calls can be dealt with by a call taker/dispatcher, who, on receipt of the call, is able<br>
    to generate an automated instruction, resulting in hard copy (e.g., computer<br>
    printout) information at the relevant Fire station.</p>
    </p>
